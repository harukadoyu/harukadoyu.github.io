## スタンフォード式 最高の睡眠 / The Stanford Method for Ultimate Sound Sleep

One of the key ideas in this book is that **sleep works like a debt**:
If you don’t get enough sleep, that missing rest accumulates as a “sleep debt,” which continues to grow unless you make up for it. On the other hand, if you’ve had enough rest and carry no debt, your body won’t crave more sleep than necessary — which is a good sign of healthy sleep balance.

### Quality Over Quantity

What matters most in sleep is not **how long** you sleep, but the **quality** of that sleep.

Sleep consists of cycles of **non-REM** and **REM** stages. The **first non-REM stage** — about the first **90 minutes after you fall asleep** — is the deepest and most restorative. That makes these first 90 minutes absolutely critical for high-quality sleep.

To maximize the quality of this period, the book highlights several practical tips:

#### 1. Body Temperature Regulation

Sleep is closely tied to **body temperature**, which can be divided into:

- **Core body temperature**
- **Skin temperature**

Normally, your core body temperature is about 2°C higher than your skin. As you prepare to sleep, your core temperature drops and moves closer to your skin temperature — a key condition for entering deep sleep.

One good way to drop the core body temperature is to take a **bath or sauna about 90 minutes before bed**. This raises your core temperature temporary, and afterward, your body works to cool down rapidly, promoting the natural temperature drop needed for sleep readiness.

#### 2. Comfortable Room Temperature

The ideal room temperature varies slightly from person to person, but keeping your sleeping environment **comfortable and slightly cool** is important for maintaining high sleep quality.

#### 3. Monotonic Mental State

The best brain condition before sleep is a **monotonic state** — when your mind is calm and not actively thinking.
This is difficult to achieve but crucial for a smooth transition into deep sleep.

### Waking Up Well

Waking up properly is also key to a healthy sleep cycle. Two important factors are:

- **Light exposure**: Sunlight (or bright light) signals your brain that it’s morning, helping reset your internal clock.
- **Raising body temperature**: Activities like taking a **shower** can help increase your body temperature and signal to your body that it's time to be alert.


By focusing on sleep quality, especially in the first 90 minutes, and understanding how body and brain states affect rest, this book offers science-based strategies to improve both how you sleep and how you wake.


## 人は聞き方が9割 / Listening Is 90% of Communication

The most important skill in everyday communication — especially outside of business settings — is not **how well you talk**, but **how well you listen**.

Humans are social creatures who naturally enjoy talking. Everyone wants someone who will truly listen to them. That’s why **good listeners are appreciated, trusted, and essential** in forming strong personal connections.

So how can you become a better listener?
Here are some key techniques the book introduces:

### How to Be a Good Listener

- **Nod while listening**
  Show that you’re engaged and following along.

- **Agree rather than disagree**
  Try to find common ground. Avoid contradicting unless truly necessary.

- **Smile**
  A gentle smile creates comfort, but be sure to adjust your expression to match the topic — empathy matters.

- **Make eye contact**
  Look at the speaker’s eyes occasionally, but not constantly. Find a natural rhythm.

- **Face the speaker**
  Lean in slightly and angle your body toward the person — your **stomach should face the talker** to show openness.

- **React often**
  Use small responses to show attentiveness.

- **Avoid negative words**
  Try not to bring in criticism or negative energy.

- **Don’t speak badly about others**
  Gossip or complaints can make others feel cautious.

- **Don’t rush to conclusions**
  Let the speaker finish and fully express themselves before jumping in with advice or opinions.


By becoming someone who listens with care and attention, you naturally become someone others want to talk to — and trust.


## スマホ脳　/ Smartphone brain

People today are addicted to smartphones. This addiction can be traced back to human history from over 100,000 years ago, when life was much harder. The smartphone era is just a tiny fraction of human history, so our brains haven't fully adapted to it yet. Much of our modern behavior, including smartphone addiction, can be explained by looking at how humans evolved.

For most of human history, people had to stay alert to survive. For example, even while picking berries, they had to watch out for predators like lions. Focusing too much on one task could be dangerous. If someone focused only on gathering berries, they might be attacked. Because of this, humans evolved to be easily distracted and aware of their surroundings.

In today’s world, the lions have been replaced by smartphones and social media. Our brains still treat them as something important that we must pay attention to. But unlike lions, smartphones are not a real threat. Our survival doesn't depend on them. However, because social media is designed to trigger dopamine—the brain’s reward chemical—they become addictive and constantly steal our attention.

Smartphones greatly disturb our ability to concentrate. Many studies have shown that even the presence of a smartphone nearby can reduce performance. The closer the phone is, the worse students performed on tests. Even when phones were kept in bags, they still had a negative effect. The best way to focus while studying or working is to leave your smartphone in a different room.


## 思考の整理学 / The Art of Thinking

### Gliders vs. Pilots: Independent Thinking in Research

In contemporary education, students are often taught to operate like gliders — following a predetermined path without the ability to change direction or exercise control. However, in research, it is essential to go beyond passive execution and instead learn to act as pilots — to navigate, make decisions, and take responsibility for the course of inquiry. This metaphor highlights a crucial distinction: effective researchers must not merely follow instructions but must cultivate the ability to think independently and critically.

### Choosing Topics and Engaging with Literature

The process of selecting a research topic should begin with a fundamental question: why? Understanding the underlying rationale for a topic is the foundation of meaningful research. Once this is established, it is necessary to examine existing literature to determine whether similar studies have been conducted and how your work might contribute to or challenge current knowledge.

When writing a thesis, it is insufficient to focus solely on one’s own research or to selectively cite studies that support a given argument. A comprehensive and academically rigorous thesis engages with a wide range of perspectives, including studies that align with as well as those that contradict one’s findings. By thoughtfully integrating insights from multiple sources — supportive and critical alike — researchers can construct a more balanced, nuanced, and compelling scholarly contribution.

### Serendipity, Creativity, and Parallel Thinking

Serendipity — the occurrence of unexpected yet fortunate discoveries — has played a significant role in the advancement of science. A similar phenomenon can be observed in the process of thinking itself. Often, the most innovative research ideas emerge not during focused contemplation, but rather when the mind is engaged with unrelated topics. This suggests that creativity in research may benefit from a degree of cognitive flexibility and mental wandering.

In this context, it can be advantageous to consider multiple, thematically related research topics simultaneously. When engaging deeply with one area, it is not uncommon for novel insights to arise that are more applicable to a different, though related, research question. Such cross-pollination of ideas can enrich the research process and lead to unexpected but valuable connections.

### Learning, Forgetting, and the Power of Summarization

While the importance of learning is widely recognized, the role of forgetting is equally essential — though perhaps less intuitive. In periods of high mental demand, the brain can become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information being processed. Creating mental space for reflection is therefore critical, and the ability to discard or temporarily set aside unnecessary information is a key aspect of effective thinking.

One useful strategy to support both learning and forgetting is summarization. Even when one believes they have a clear understanding of a topic, this knowledge may remain inaccessible or fragmented if it is not well organized. By actively summarizing and articulating one’s thoughts — whether through writing or discussion — it becomes possible to clarify, consolidate, and more effectively utilize existing knowledge. In this way, outputting one’s thinking is not only a form of expression, but also a powerful tool for cognitive refinement.

### Avoiding Intellectual Inbreeding through Interdisciplinarity

Intellectual inbreeding can also occur within scientific research, where ideas and methodologies become overly insular or self-referential. When research remains confined within a single discipline or theoretical framework, it may lack the diversity of perspectives needed to generate novel insights. History has shown that breakthroughs often emerge when scholars adopt a broader view — integrating knowledge, methods, and approaches from multiple disciplines. Interdisciplinary research, by bridging conceptual boundaries, fosters innovation and allows researchers to address complex problems in more holistic and creative ways.
