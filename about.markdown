This site was inspired by the book
**「科学的根拠に基づく最高の勉強法 / *Maximizing Learning: The Best Evidence-Based Techniques***,
which introduced me to powerful learning methods like **active recall** and **distributed learning**.
You can find my summary and reflections on the book [here](https://harukadoyu.github.io/jekyll/update/2025/04/14/learning.html).

The core idea behind this site is simple: writing helps me learn better.
